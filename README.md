# SurfaceAreaFinder
The goal of this program was to find the surface area of any flat object in a picture, using a reference. This was the proof of concept to a much larger idea dealing with a mobile app that would allow you to take a picture, mark boundaries around an object, and then find information about that object (the parabolic function of the golden gate bridge's arches,  the height of a car, etc). Most of the code is not mine, JFrame and I are not friends.
